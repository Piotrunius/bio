### Pull Requests

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep it focused**: One feature/fix per PR

- **Test your changes**: Make sure everything works as expected
- **Update documentation**: If you change functionality, update the README
- **Follow the existing code style**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase
- **Keep it small**: Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors and common values
- Follow BEM naming convention where applicable
- Keep selectors specific but not overly complex
- Group related styles together
- Add comments to separate major sections
